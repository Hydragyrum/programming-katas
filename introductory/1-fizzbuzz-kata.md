## The FizzBuzz Kata

The FizzBuzz kata is inspired by a game played by young children to teach them division. Because of its simplicity, we can use it to see the first principles of clean code and software crafstmanship emerge.

This kata is also a good starting point to begin learning the basics of test-driven development.

### The Kata

We want to be able to print the numbers between 1 and 100. 
- If the number is divisible by 3, we want to print `Fizz` instead of this number. 
- If the number is divisible by 5, we want to print `Buzz` instead. 
- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, we want to print `FizzBuzz`. 

Should be easy enough, right?
